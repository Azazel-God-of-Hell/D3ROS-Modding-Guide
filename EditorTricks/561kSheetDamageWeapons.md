# 561k Damage Weapon
This is the highest damge weapon you can make. Yes there are ways to make a [740k Damage Weapon](730kSheetDamageWeapons.md), but thats actually an inflated number, and does about half the damage in practice.  

### Formula
* **Weapon:** on the 6 base affixs put the highest Damage afex from the Damage (Y-Y) section. For the 7th affix in the mystic tab, put your 3 sockets.  Also, in the Property tab, set the Tier Quality to the `Professionals Russian Fast Sword` Under the developer weapons section.  
* **Legendary Gem of ease:** Flood all 7 affixs with the 10-40% Damage from the "Damage" section.  
* **2x Flawless Royal Rubies:** 10-40% Damage on both mystic affixs
