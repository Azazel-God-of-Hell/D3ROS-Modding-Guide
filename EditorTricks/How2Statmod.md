# Basics of StatModding

Statmodding is the act of modding your stats through manually changing your paragon points spent in different stats.

### Getting started
**1.** Make a Toon, and get some paraon on it. go through all your paragon stats and spend 1 point on everything.

**2.** Export to editor. Change its class to a different class with a different mainstat.

**3.** Load the save and spend 1 point in mainstat again.

**4.** Repeat this till you have points spent in every stat and all 3 mainstats aswell (INT, STR, DEX)

**5.** Now, once youve done that, open your save up again in the editor.

**6.** Go to the tab for your Toon, and change it back to the class you want it to be.

**7.** You'll notice on the main tab for your toon, there will be a box that's titled "Unknown". Click it.

**8.** This should drop down a menu where you can manually set all of your points in each stat.

**9.** And thats it. Play arround with the numbers and have fun. :)

### Note
Keep in mind, these are 32bit integers. so the max and min values are as follows:

**MAX:** 2,147,483,647

**MIN:** -2,147,483,648
