# 730k Damage Weapon
This is the highest (that I know of) damage weapon you can make. Though technically the [561k Damage Weapon](561kSheetDamageWeapons.md) hits harder, this is still unique in its own right. The reason being is that on the weapon we achieve the 730k Damage by going over 5aps, however when translated to your charachters sheet stats it caps at 5aps so in practice, this has about half the actual dps value of the 561k Damage Weapon. But, big numbers are still big numbers, and who doesnt love bigger numbers?

### Formula
* **Weapon:** On the first 2 base affixs put the highest Damage affix from the Damage (Y-Y) section. For the other 4 base affixs put the highers attack speed affix. For the 7th affix in the mystic tab, put your 3 sockets.  Also, in the Property tab, set the Tier Quality to the `Professionals Russian Fast Sword` Under the developer weapons section.  
* **Legendary Gem of ease:** On the first 2 base affixs put the highest Damage affix from the Damage (Y-Y) section. On the other 4 bas affixs as well as the mystic affix, flood it all with the 10-40% Damage from the "Damage" section. For Tier Quality in the Properties tab, put the `PVP Axe 10`.  
* **2x Flawless Royal Rubies:** 10-40% Damage on both mystic affixes. For Tier Quality in the Properties tab, put the `PVP Crossbow`.
