### Naming
[Naming Items](NamingItems.md)

### Affixs
The Affixs work like any other piece of gear. You can add the 6 base affixs and add the 7th in the mystic tab.  
_(NOTE: Do not put sockets on gems)_

### Augmenting
Yes you can augment Legendary gems. No special trick to it. There are a few however that wont augment but I cant remember them off the top of my head. You'll just have to expiriment and see for yourself. :)  

### Socketing
No special trick here either. Socket into gear like normal.
