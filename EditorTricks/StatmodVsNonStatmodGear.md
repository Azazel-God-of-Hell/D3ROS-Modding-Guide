# Statmod vs. Non-Statmod Gear
The main difference is that with gear for statmodded accounts, you have much more freedom because it doesnt matter as much. However for non statmod gear, you need to make sure Its viable for gr150s.  
  
For non stat modded gear sets need and may very based on class and skill set Cooldown Reduction and Resourse Cost Reduction and all. Here's some general rules of thumb when making non statmod gear:  
* sets need 5 Critical Hit Chance and 4 Critical Hit Damage (highest affix in selection)  
* you will want to incorperate the Billion Damage Ring  
* Pickup radius helps a lot
